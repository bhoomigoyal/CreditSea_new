# Loan Manager Application

This project is a **Loan Manager Application** built for CreditSea's Full Stack Intern assignment. The primary goal of this application is to integrate the user application form with a dashboard that displays statistics, using **TypeScript** and **Node.js** for backend development, and **MongoDB** for managing user data.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Frontend** (React with Vite) – A simple yet functional frontend to submit loan application forms.
2. **Backend** (Node.js with TypeScript) – A backend that processes form data, stores it in MongoDB, and updates the dashboard with real-time statistics.
